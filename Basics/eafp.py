# Duck typing and easier to ask forgiveness than permissions (EAFP)
# pythonic‚Äù describes a coding style that leverages Python's unique features to write code that is readable and beautiful

# DUCK TYPING
# focus on what the object can do, instead of what it is
# we dont care what object we are dealing with, we only care if it does what we ask it to do
